# simple-pe-loader
This is Windows PE format file loader application that provides functionality similar to the OS internal executable file loader, but runs from the user mode. It maps an executable file to the memory, patches and initializes several mechanisms and then passes control flow to the loaded image. This project was developed for educational purposes.
